# Alternative RLCraft, in development
We created this modpack because we really enjoyed the RLCraft experience. but felt like some things were just really unfair. 
The goal of this modpack is to keep the spirit of RLCraft alive by keeping most of the mechanics, but making changes to the early game,
so certain mechanics are more difficult to abuse. Most of the dungeon loot was hot garbage, so we made our own changes to loot tables to make them
worth it, especially considering the difficulty of the pack. We also found the endgame to be extremely lackluster, and added new content.

### This is not a superset of RLCraft! We removed some mods and changed existing configs.
More details will be listed below in the changelog:

## Intended Progression:
1. Standard overworld stuff. Build a base, farm some crops and animals, mine ores.
2. Go to Lost Cities. We found Lost Cities to be in a weird place, where mobs were too difficult until you could get some good diamond/Lycanites gear. However, by then the loot you can obtain there is obsolete. A global 25% health and damage reduction is applied to all mobs in Lost Cities, however they receive a speed potion effect. (Pro tip: the cursed buildings prevent you from opening the chests but you can just bring them outside and open them there using CarryOn mod)
3. Explore Defiled Lands, and get some book wyrms. Kill the bosses, as the drops are used in later recipes!
4. Kill dragons, as per usual.
5. Kill Lycanites bosses. Loot tables are updated and are slightly nerfed because they lag out computers with all the particles. If you are feeling bold, change the healths back in the config.
6. This is a good time to min-max your equipment. Apotheosis and Industrial Foregoing exists for this. 
7. Enter the Twilight Forest. The portal item is the Wraith Sigil dropped from Lycanites bosses. In this dimension, Normal mobs have a global 100% attack and health buff, and move faster. The bosses have been made incredibly difficult. We designed it so unless you have min-maxed your gear, you will not have a fun time.
8. FUTURE IDEAS: Content for post Twilight Forest (thinking about Tinker's Construct and some more tech), and AbyssalCraft as the final dimension.

## Changelog (in no order of importance)
1. New world generation! We didn't like the randomness of normal worldgen, so we created our custom world generation using BoP and Dimension Control with a custom heatmap (WIP, but mostly makes sense). To use this option, when selecting a world type, change to "Preset: unchartedTerritories". Travelling in the z-direction changes temperature, and travelling in the x-direction changes wetness. Also, spawning is reverted to normal, so you don't get put in a random location when you die and don't have a spawnpoint. However, mobs get stronger the further from spawnchunks you go.
2. Ice and Fire updated to 1.9.1! Players now have access to dragonsteel, however the dragonforge is gated by completion of Defiled Lands. Additionally, dread mobs exist in this version. They have been buffed a lot too. Custom recipes are added for the new Ice and Fire weapons. 
3. Gave a little bit of stuff for the engineers to do. Immersive Engineering and Industrial Foregoing added. Teslacorelib machine cases (core component for any IF machines) are gated by killing dragons, but you can occasionally find them in dungeons too. Make good food with automated farms and defend your base with Immersive Engineering turrets!
4. Combat system has been tweaked (see following bullets as well). Two-handers hit like a truck, but you can't block with them. One-handers don't do much damage, but the options of a shield in the off-hand or dual-wielding are opened up. Jump-crits are allowed.
5. Armoreable mobs added to give vanilla mobs a bit more punch. 
6. Zombie Awareness added to give them brains of their own. Zombies have more advanced AI and will tend to clump. They are also significantly healthier than before.
7. Rebirth of the Mobs added. Some mobs (notably Twilight Forest) are immune to bows, and they can also inflict various potion effects on you.
8. Other creature mods like Mo' Creatures and Mowzie's Mobs added. Some of their equipments are buffed.
9. Hardcore Darkness added, where nighttime visibility is directly correlated with moon phases. Expect to see nothing during new moon.
10. Nutrition mod added. We thought food was very much neglected, so keeping high nutrition can provide you with various buffs. Can still eat even when hunger bar is full. There is no punishment for having low nutrition, though maintaining a balanced diet is recommended. Cooking with Blockheads added to make cooking easier. Make those farms!
11. Mystical World, Roots, and Nature's Aura added. Gives players some options for early game loot.
12. Treasure2 added, with custom loot tables. Incentivizes exploring.
13. Electroblob's Wizardry added. Lycanite's wands were lackluster, so now you can use these ones! Reskillable/Compatskills is kind of bugged with the newest Electroblob's Wizardry, don't worry about it too much.
14. Colytra added, cause elytras were literally useless in RLCraft. Backpacks are nerfed in capacity but don't occupy the chest slot.
15. First Aid healing items buffed, but things can still easily one-hit you when hitting the head or the chest. This means prioritize chest and head armor over legs and feet.
16. Unnecessary graphics (like explosion ringing and blindness, Better Foliage, Dynamic trees) removed. Better for potato PCs.
17. Apotheosis added to get better enchantments. Trust me, you WILL need good enchantments. Xaphan farms are dead.
18. Fishing loot buffed. Neptunium is used in some new recipes as well.
19. Combat has been tweaked significantly. There are now dedicated "agility" class weapons, notably the throwing ones and those that swing at faster speeds (ie. dagger, throwing axe, etc.)
20. Featuring 3 dedicated classes - wizard, druid, and engineer - each with their own progressions and unlockables. Wizard is supported by Electroblob's Wizardry and its addons, Druid is supported by Nature's Aura and Roots, while engineer leans toward Immersive Engineering, TeslaCore and Industrial Foregoing. Note that some classes excel at more defensive roles than others. Alternatively, feel free to multiclass like before.
21. Equipment modifiers from QualityTools are reworked so that they are more punishing if bad, and more rewarding if good. This is inspired from blacksmithing in Skyrim - A lower tier item with a good modifier EASILY outdamages a higher tier item without a modifier at all.
